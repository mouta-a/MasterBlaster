# MasterBlaster

University project made in Unity. Top down 3D shooter game where you can kill robots that spawn in waves and get to the next level. 

I worked mainly on creating characters and weapons in Voxels for this game. I also built the levels for this game and made the UI components for this project.  
 
 The pictures in this README is a small showcase on some of the things I made during this project:

The game is playable, but a DUALSHOCK®4 (Playstation 4) controller is needed for controls. After downloading the project, just plug in the controller
and run the MasterBlaster.exe file in the main folder to run the game.
